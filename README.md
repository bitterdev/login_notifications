# Login Notifications

Login Notifications is a powerful add-on for Concrete CMS that helps you keep your website secure by monitoring user login activity. Whenever a user successfully logs in from a device or browser that hasnâ€™t been used before, the system automatically sends a customizable email notification. This allows users or administrators to react quickly in case of unauthorized access attempts.

The add-on stores anonymized device and browser information and only sends alerts when a new environment is detected, reducing unnecessary notifications.

With multilingual support, customizable mail templates, and full integration into the Concrete CMS user system, Login Notifications is a seamless and effective way to improve account transparency and security across your platform.
